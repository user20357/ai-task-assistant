# 🧪 Testing Your AI Task Assistant

Your app is now running! Here's how to test the visual guidance feature:

## 🎯 Quick Test Steps

### 1. **Start a Conversation**
In the chat window, type something like:
```
Help me upload a file to a website
```

### 2. **Wait for AI Response**
The AI will respond and ask clarifying questions.

### 3. **Start Guidance**
You now have **TWO ways** to start guidance:

**Option A: Automatic Detection**
- The "🎯 Start Guidance" button should become enabled
- Click it when it turns green

**Option B: Force Start (Always Available)**
- Click the "🚀 Force Start" button
- This works even if auto-detection fails

### 4. **Visual Guidance Mode**
Once guidance starts:
- ✅ The main window minimizes to a floating chat
- ✅ Orange boxes appear around clickable elements
- ✅ You get step-by-step instructions
- ✅ Click on highlighted elements to proceed

## 🔧 What Should Happen

### **Before Guidance:**
- Chat interface with AI conversation
- Two buttons: "🎯 Start Guidance" and "🚀 Force Start"

### **During Guidance:**
- Floating chat window
- Orange overlay boxes on screen elements
- Step-by-step voice/text instructions
- Screen detection every 2 seconds

### **Screen Detection:**
- Uses your deployed backend: `https://screensage-backend.onrender.com`
- Falls back to local OpenCV detection if backend fails
- Detects buttons, text fields, links, and UI elements

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"Start Guidance" Button Not Enabling?**
- Use "🚀 Force Start" instead
- This bypasses auto-detection

### **No Orange Boxes Appearing?**
- Check the console logs for detection errors
- Backend might be slow (Render.com free tier)
- Local fallback detection should still work

### **App Crashes?**
- Check if all dependencies are installed
- Run `python test_setup.py` to verify setup

## 🎮 Test Scenarios

Try these tasks to test different features:

1. **File Upload Task**
   ```
   Help me upload my resume to a job website
   ```

2. **Form Filling Task**
   ```
   Help me fill out a contact form on a website
   ```

3. **General Navigation**
   ```
   Help me navigate to Gmail and compose an email
   ```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

1. **Chat Phase**: AI asks questions, understands your task
2. **Guidance Phase**: Visual overlays guide you step-by-step
3. **Completion**: Task completes, returns to chat mode

**🎉 Your AI Task Assistant is ready!** 

The key improvement is that you now have **visual guidance with screen detection** instead of just chat instructions. The orange boxes will highlight exactly what to click!
